We use the form of Abrams (2022, pg. 39), which replaces inter- and intra-specific competition terms so that each species has a neutral parameter, $\\alpha$. We then have\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eqn:simple-lv}\n\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = N_1(r_1 - \\alpha_{11}N_1 - \\alpha_{12}N2)\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = N_2(r_2 - \\alpha_{21}N_1 - \\alpha_{22}N2)\n\n\\end{eqeuation}\n$$\n\nSince we are also ultimately interested \n\nNOTES:\n\n1.  Maybe interesting to actually use the ones with inter- and intra-specific competition so we can have the within-species term have some additional dynamics with respect to the infected organisms being out-competed by their susceptible conspecifics?\n:::\n\n",
