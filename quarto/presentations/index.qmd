# Background

## Biodiversity & Ecosystem Functioning (BEF)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: incremental
- Greater biodiversity leads to greater ecosystem functioning 
- Elton (1958) said that greater diversity would drive greater function, reified in the 90s/00s by Tillman, Huston, Loreau

So here I've stolen one of Colin's figures from his paper with Ellen Bannon

## On the predictability of timeseries disease data{.smaller}

- What is a timeseries
- How do we think about modeling them? 
- Are they in fact predictable? 

## Intrinsic vs. realized predictability{.smaller}

- What is the difference 

# Wavelets, DLMs, and variance decomposition, oh my!{.smaller}

## Regressing messy data{.smaller}

- signal vs noise
- how to approach extracting signal

## Wavelets, wavelet-packets, and DWT{.smaller}

- these things

## Maximal overlap wavelet-packet transformation

- go through high vs low pass filters 
- the math behind it

## Distributed lag models 

- what is a lag 
- why and how to fit a lag

# If one fits a model, one is obligated to forecast with it 

## Forecasting off a DLM

- some of the challenges
- why it's useful 

## Variance partitioning 

- an essential way to asses performance of the model 
- an even more essential way to understand the basic underpining of one's understanding of the process variance still to be modeled

# The annoying side-note of data availability 

## Data at present

::: {.fragment .fade-out}

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
Fade in, then out

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Slide up while fading in

# Contextualizing regression models with fully expanded spatial models 

## What else impacts disease transmission

- we can model these other processes for a small handful of diseases
- it's important to do so, so that we can actually nail down what we're really missing when we take a "hands over eyes" regression approach 

## Future aims to do so with flu case study
