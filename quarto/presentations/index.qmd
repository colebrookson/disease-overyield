## Biodiversity & Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) {.center}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
- Greater biodiversity leads to greater ecosystem functioning 
- Elton (1958) said that greater diversity would drive greater function, reified in the 90s/00s by Tillman, Huston, Loreau

**But through what mechanism?**

## The simple case of monoculture can provide valuable insight {.center}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
- Original theory came from monoculture experiments and grasslands
- Two (or more) species growing together could out-perform a single species 
- Niche complimentarity is often used to substantiate this

::: {.notes}
The idea here is that if you're using abundance or biomass as your measure of interest, you'll end up with a higher yeild over the same area if there is more biodiversity than if just a single species was growing at it's carrying capacity in monoculture due to factors 
:::

## How can we measure this BEF relationship? {.center}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
- When does a mixture out-perform the highest yeilding monoculture? 
- Easiest to think about this with respect to classic Lotka-Volterra models

- To put in terms of carrying capacity $(K)$    
  - $\alpha_{ii} = 1/K_i$
  - $\alpha{ij} = \alpha_ij / K_i$

## Transgressive overyielding 


- signal vs noise
- how to approach extracting signal

## Wavelets, wavelet-packets, and DWT{.smaller}

- these things

## Maximal overlap wavelet-packet transformation

- go through high vs low pass filters 
- the math behind it

## Distributed lag models 

- what is a lag 
- why and how to fit a lag

# If one fits a model, one is obligated to forecast with it 

## Forecasting off a DLM

- some of the challenges
- why it's useful 

## Variance partitioning 

- an essential way to asses performance of the model 
- an even more essential way to understand the basic underpining of one's understanding of the process variance still to be modeled

# Contextualizing regression models with fully expanded spatial models 

## What else impacts disease transmission

- we can model these other processes for a small handful of diseases
- it's important to do so, so that we can actually nail down what we're really missing when we take a "hands over eyes" regression approach 

## Future aims to do so with flu case study
