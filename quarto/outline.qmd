We start from the assumption of two species competing, in a Lotka-Volterra model. We use the form of Abrams (2022, pg. 39), which replaces inter- and intra-specific competition terms so that each species has a neutral parameter, $\alpha$. We then have

$$
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:simple-lv}

\frac{dN_1}{dt} = N_1(r_1 - \alpha_{11}N_1 - \alpha_{12}N2)
\frac{dN_2}{dt} = N_2(r_2 - \alpha_{21}N_1 - \alpha_{22}N2)

\end{eqeuation}
$$

Since we are also ultimately interested 

NOTES:

1.  Maybe interesting to actually use the ones with inter- and intra-specific competition so we can have the within-species term have some additional dynamics with respect to the infected organisms being out-competed by their susceptible conspecifics?
