\section{Background}

Previous work has shown that the coexistence of a pair or mixture of species can reach higher abundance than the species with the highest carrying capacity 

\section{Methods}

We start from the assumption of two species competing, in a Lotka-Volterra model. We use the form of Abrams (2022, pg. 39), which includes terms for both inter- and intra-specific competition. We then have

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:simple-lv-1}
  \frac{dN_1}{dt} = N_1(r_1 - \alpha_{11}N_1 - \alpha_{12}N_2)
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:simple-lv-2}
  \frac{dN_2}{dt} = N_2(r_2 - \alpha_{21}N_1 - \alpha_{22}N_2)
\end{equation}

The relation to the original generalized Lotka-Volterra model (as pointed out by Abrams 2022) is that $\alpha_{ii} = \frac{1}{K_i}$ and $\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\alpha_{ij}}{K_i}$. 

\begin{table}[hpt]

\begin{tabular}{ |m{4cm}||m{7cm}|}
     \hline
     \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Model Parameters} \\
     \hline
     \textbf{Term} & \textbf{Description} \\
     \hline
     $N_i$ & Abundance of species $i$ \\
     $r_i$ & Growth rate of species $i$ \\
     $\alpha_{ii}$ & Intraspecific competition within species $i$ \\
     $\alpha_{ij}$ & Interspecific competition between species $i$ and $j$ \\
     \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameter values for our model systems}
\label{table:parameters}
\end{table}

Since we are also ultimately interested in the dynamics when one of these competing species is infected with some type of pathogen, we can additionally consider species 1 as being infected with a generalized pathogen.
