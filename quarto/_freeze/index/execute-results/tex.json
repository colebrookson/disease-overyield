We use the form of Abrams (2022, pg. 39), which includes terms for both inter- and intra-specific competition. We then have\n\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eqn:simple-lv-1}\n  \\frac{dN_1}{dt} = N_1(r_1 - \\alpha_{11}N_1 - \\alpha_{12}N_2)\n\\end{equation} \\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eqn:simple-lv-2}\n  \\frac{dN_2}{dt} = N_2(r_2 - \\alpha_{21}N_1 - \\alpha_{22}N_2)\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe relation to the original generalized Lotka-Volterra model (as pointed out by Abrams 2022) is that $\\alpha_{ii} = \\frac{1}{K_i}$ and $\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\alpha_{ij}}{K_i}$. \n\n\\begin{table}[hpt]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ |m{4cm}||m{7cm}|}\n     \\hline\n     \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Model Parameters} \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\textbf{Term} & \\textbf{Description} \\\\\n     \\hline\n     $N_i$ & Abundance of species $i$ \\\\\n     $r_i$ & Growth rate of species $i$ \\\\\n     $\\alpha_{ii}$ & Intraspecific competition within species $i$ \\\\\n     $\\alpha_{ij}$ & Interspecific competition between species $i$ and $j$ \\\\\n     \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Parameter values for our model systems}\n\\label{table:parameters}\n\\end{table}\n\nSince we are also ultimately interested in the dynamics when one of these competing species is infected with some type of pathogen, we can additionally consider species 1 as being infected with a generalized pathogen.\n:::\n\n",
