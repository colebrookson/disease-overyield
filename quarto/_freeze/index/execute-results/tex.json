This idea of \"transgressive overyielding\" is the basis for much work on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships (BEF) [i.e., @schmid_biodiversity_2008]. Some research has suggested approaches to linking this concept to disease dynamics [@johnson_frontiers_2015], however, few studies have explicitly developed theory to this effect. Noteably @sieben_quantifying_2022 and others have provided elegant frameworks for considering competition and coexistence from the perspective of parasites themselves existing in both between- and within-host frameworks. However, \\textbf{what effects do infection dynamics have on transgressive overyielding?} Is it possible that the inclusion of pathogen dynamics into classic models of competition would change the conditions under which transgressive overyielding is founded? If so, what is the relation of the virulence of the infection and the basic reproductive number $\\mathcal{R_0}$?\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\nWe start from the assumption of two species competing, in a Lotka-Volterra model. We use the form of @abrams_competition_2022[pg. 39], which includes terms for both inter- and intra-specific competition. We then have\n\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eqn:simple-lv-1}\n  \\frac{dN_1}{dt} = N_1(r_1 - \\alpha_{11}N_1 - \\alpha_{12}N_2)\n\\end{equation} \\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eqn:simple-lv-2}\n  \\frac{dN_2}{dt} = N_2(r_2 - \\alpha_{21}N_1 - \\alpha_{22}N_2)\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe relation to the original generalized Lotka-Volterra model (as pointed out by Abrams 2022) is that $\\alpha_{ii} = \\frac{1}{K_i}$ and $\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\alpha_{ij}}{K_i}$. \n\n\\begin{table}[hpt]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ |m{4cm}||m{7cm}|}\n     \\hline\n     \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Model Parameters} \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\textbf{Term} & \\textbf{Description} \\\\\n     \\hline\n     $N_i$ & Abundance of species $i$ \\\\\n     $r_i$ & Growth rate of species $i$ \\\\\n     $\\alpha_{ii}$ & Intraspecific competition within species $i$ \\\\\n     $\\alpha_{ij}$ & Interspecific competition between species $i$ and $j$ \\\\\n     \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Parameter values for our model systems}\n\\label{table:parameters}\n\\end{table}\n\nSince we are also ultimately interested in the dynamics when one of these competing species is infected with some type of pathogen, we can additionally consider species 1 as being infected with a generalized pathogen. The following system is the one considered: \n\n\n```{dot}\ngraph G {\n  layout=neato\n  run -- intr;\n  intr -- runbl;\n  runbl -- run;\n  run -- kernel;\n  kernel -- zombie;\n  kernel -- sleep;\n  kernel -- runmem;\n  sleep -- swap;\n  swap -- runswap;\n  runswap -- new;\n  runswap -- runmem;\n  new -- runmem;\n  sleep -- runmem;\n}\n```\n\n\n\\section{References}\n:::\n\n",
